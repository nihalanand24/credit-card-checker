# Credit Card Checker
- Input any number to check if it is a valid credit card number using Luhn's (modulo 10) algorithm.
- If the number is valid, the app further identifies the type of card the number belongs to (i.e. MasterCard, Visa, American Express)

All calculations are completed client side (in the user's browser) and no information is stored or uploaded anywhere.
